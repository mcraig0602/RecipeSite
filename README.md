This is one of my first javascript projects. That i wrote the whole code with out editing an already existing project. It just lets you enter recipes and adds them to a list.

Completed:
-added recipes to masterlist
-Learned about object literals, so that shortened up my JS a little bit(still a work in progress)

Upcoming updates:
-Add recipes to master list with servings
-setup a mongodb or firebase server
-Add recipe viewer below master ingredient list
-try writing html in Jade

Longterm:
-scrape the web for recipes
-Rewrite it in Angular or React
-start adding categories to sort recipes better
