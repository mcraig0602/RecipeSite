This is one of my first javascript projects. That i wrote the whole code with out editing an already existing project. It just lets you enter recipes and adds them to a list.

Completed:
-Mostly fixed the add recipe to recipebook
-fixed some styling issues

Upcoming updates:
-Add recipes to master list with servings
-Convert to bootstrap or css grid
-setup a mongodb or firebase server

Longterm:
-scrape the web for recipes
-Rewrite it in Angular or React
-start adding categories to sort recipes better
