This is one of my first javascript projects. That i wrote the whole code with out editing an already existing project. It just lets you enter recipes and adds them to a list.

Completed:
-fixed remove line from master list to also remove items from child tab list
-need to fix line numbers on child tab list after master removal
-Add recipe viewer below master ingredient list
-Add recipes to master list
-updated gulp to minify js

Upcoming updates:
-setup a mongodb or firebase server
-probably should add a category for each ingredient and recipe
-onclick of active recipe in master list hide ingredients
-add ingredients and be able to change qty after initial
-determine what is the best way to display/convert units based on ingredients
-convert decimal to fraction? Maybe

Longterm:
-scrape the web for recipes
-Rewrite it in Angular or React
-start adding categories to sort recipes better
