This is one of my first javascript projects. That i wrote the whole code with out editing an already existing project. It just lets you enter recipes and adds them to a list.

Completed:
-Add new recipe is partially fixed, but issues with the datalist for ingredients and recipes is glitchy.

Upcoming updates:
-Add recipes to master list with servings
-Automatically add unit after selecting a ingredient
-Add new recipe

Longterm:
-scrape the web for recipes
-Rewrite it in Angular or React
