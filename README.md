This is one of my first javascript projects. That i wrote the whole code with out editing an already existing project. It just lets you enter recipes and adds them to a list.

Completed:
-Converted to bootstrap
-Added Gulp integrations for sass and jade preprocessor

Upcoming updates:

-setup a mongodb or firebase server
-Add recipe viewer below master ingredient list
-try writing html in Jade

Longterm:

-Rewrite it in Angular or React
-start adding categories to sort recipes better
